Hydro is a system that automatically applies the hyperparameter transfer theory together with multiple system techniques to jointly improve the tuning efficiency. To learn more about how Hydro works, please refer our [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/hu).

We highlight three key features of Hydro:

ðŸš€ **Efficient Tuning**. Hydro scales down the model size and fuses multiple trials can significantly improve training throughput and hardware efficiency.

âœ¨ **Automatic Pipeline**. Hydro streamlines the surrogate model generation process and seamlessly integrates with Ray, offering a user-friendly solution for tuning.

ðŸŽ‰ **Quality Maintenance**. Hydro typically can well maintain the tuned model quality even using a scaled and fused model for tuning.

## Getting Started

Refer to [Getting started](https://s-lab-system-group.github.io/Hydro/) for complete instructions on environment setup, installation, and integration.



## Installation

Hydro is published as a Python package and can be installed with pip directly.

```
pip install hydro-tune
```

### Docker Image

We also provide a Docker image fully equipped with all dependencies and environments.

```sh
docker pull tonyhao96/hydro
```
## Examples

We provide working examples for end-to-end hyperparameter tuning inside [`examples`](examples) folder.
