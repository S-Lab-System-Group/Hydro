<h1>Surrogate-based Hyperparameter Tuning System</h1>
</div>


Hydro is a system that automatically applies the hyperparameter transfer theory together with multiple system techniques to jointly improve the tuning efficiency.

ðŸš€ **Efficient Tuning**. Hydro scales down the model size and fuses multiple trials can significantly improve training throughput and hardware efficiency.

âœ¨ **Automatic Pipeline**. Hydro streamlines the surrogate model generation process and seamlessly integrates with Ray, offering a user-friendly solution for tuning.

ðŸŽ‰ **Quality Maintenance**. Hydro typically can well maintain the tuned model quality even using a scaled and fused model for tuning.
